CMDKit Framework
================

The CMDKit Framework, or Command Kit Framework, is a framework that helps make Objective-C programs for the UNIX Command Line.  
Written in Objective-C, it uses Apple's Foundation Framework that comes with every Mac.



Note:  
  
Specifically made for Mac. It uses the Foundation Framework, so not even the source code could be recompiled in such a way that it works on Linux.

Therefore it won't work on Linux or Windows.

However, you're welcome to rewrite it so that it works on other platforms. If you choose to publish the modified code, please attribute me, or even better, include a link to the original repository.

Thanks!
