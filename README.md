CMDKit Framework
================

A framework to help with making Objective-C programs for the UNIX Command Line.  
Written in Objective-C, it uses Apple's Foundation Framework that comes with every Mac.

It's almost finished, so look out for its release in the near future.

COMING SOON!

Note:  
  
Specifically made for Mac. It uses the Foundation Framework, so not even the source code could be recompiled in such a way that it works on Linux.

Therefore it won't work on Linux or Windows.

I may make a C/C++ version soon, which doesn't depend on the Foundation Framework or having Objective-C installed, so that Linux users can use the source code as well.  
It will need to be recompiled, and can only be packaged into a framework if it's for a Mac.  
Linux users could use the source code instead.  
For Windows, it will take a bit of redesigning...
