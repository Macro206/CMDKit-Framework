CMDKit Framework
================

The CMDKit Framework, or Command Kit Framework, is a framework that helps make Objective-C programs for the UNIX Command Line.  




Note:  
  
Specifically made for Mac. It uses the Foundation Framework, which is available by default on Macs

Therefore it won't work on Linux or Windows.

However, you're welcome to rewrite it (e.g. in C++) so that it works on other platforms. If you choose to publish the modified code, please attribute me, or even better, include a link to the original repository.

Thanks!
